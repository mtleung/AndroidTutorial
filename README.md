# AndroidTutorial
Sample Android projects, each introducing a new library/feature/concept

### 01 - Vanilla
Core project introducing [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for interacting with HTTP API  
Subsequent projects build on this

### 02 - Model View Presenter 
Builds on top of the vanilla project to use the MVP architecture (no library)    
Some code based on work from [Remind](http://engineering.remind.com/android-code-that-scales/) and [Konmik](https://github.com/konmik/konmik.github.io/wiki/Introduction-to-Model-View-Presenter-on-Android)

### 03 - Dependency Injection  _TODO_
Update the MVP project to use [Dagger 2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) for dependency injection
